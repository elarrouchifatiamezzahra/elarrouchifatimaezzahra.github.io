About Me
Hey! I'm Fatima Ezzahra El Arrouchi. I studied computer stuff at the Higher School of Technology Casablanca.

What I'm Good At
I know how to make things on computers using languages like C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can also do some cool stuff with Linux and write scripts.

In school, I learned about building websites, how computers talk to each other, and even how they work inside.

My Projects
Mastermind Game (C)
Remember that game where you guess a secret code? I made a computer version of it using C. It was fun trying to make the computer guess the code!

E-Commerce Web Project
Ever wanted to make your own online store? Me and my friends made one! You can buy and sell things on our website. It was a big team effort and turned out great.

Arduino and Assembly Project
I like playing with gadgets too! I made something cool using Arduino and Assembly language. It was like building with electronic Lego blocks, but cooler. We made a neat gadget that did some cool stuff.

My Skills and Traits
I'm good at leading teams and keeping things chill when stuff gets stressful. I'm also really curious and love learning new things.
